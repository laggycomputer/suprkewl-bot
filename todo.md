### ToDo

Here's a list of todos for this project. Expect this to change often.

1. Add user status command (currently in progress as s!profile in testing file):
  a. Preferably an embed.
  b. Should include status (online, idle, etc.), server joined date (would render s!joined obsolete), and Discord join date.
2. Copy discord.pw server custom emotes that are useful to the SuprKewl Bot support server, so that we can maintain our own copy of the emotes.
3. Add command to check channel permissions.
4. The variables in s!housefight look like a madhouse. Possibly move fighter-specific varaibles under a new fighter subclass of discord.Member.
5. Add hidden cog reload command, with bot owner check
6. add cooldown error catch and reinvoke, catch role error on s!roleinfo
7. add command (owner only) to exec(something passes as a param). Make sure it works, doesn't seem to.
