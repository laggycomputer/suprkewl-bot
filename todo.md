### ToDo

Here's a list of todos for this project. Expect this to change often.

1. Add user status command:
  a. Preferably an embed.
  b. Should include status (online, idle, etc.), server joined date (would render s!joined obsolete), and Discord join date.
2. Copy discord.pw server custom emotes that are useful to the SuprKewl Bot support server, so that we can maintain our own copy of the emotes.
3. Add command to check channel permissions.
