### ToDo

Here's a list of todos for this project. Expect this to change often.

1. Add user status command:
  a. Preferably an embed.
  b. Should include status (online, idle, etc.), server joined date (would render s!joined obsolete), and Discord join date.
2. Add command to check channel permissions.
