# SuprKewl Bot

An open-sourced Discord bot. Moderation, fun, and user info! 
If one wants to self-host this bot, place your token in the main file (replace the example), and install `discord.py@rewrite` (we don't have any voice functionality yet). In addition to discord.py itself reqiring 3.5+, some of the functions in this bot require **Python 3.6**.
