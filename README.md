# SuprKewl Bot

An open-sourced Discord bot. We've moderation, fun, user info, and more planned.
If you want to self-host this bot, place your token in the main file (replace the example token). You also need to `pip install` `discord.py@rewrite` (no need for voice, we don't have any voice functionality yet) and `jishaku`.
In addition to discord.py itself reqiring 3.5+, some of the functions in this bot require **Python 3.6**.
