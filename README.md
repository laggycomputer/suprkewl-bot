An open-sourced Discord bot. We've moderation, fun, user info, and more planned.
If you want to host this bot, place your token, and Redis server IP (can be internal), port, and password (don't set one if you don't want to use one). Then, install Redis on your host of choice. Finally, you can use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` at the root of this repo to install the requirements, and `./purgepyc.sh` to purge `__pycache__` from all code folders.
