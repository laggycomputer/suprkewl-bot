An open-sourced Discord bot. Features such as moderation, just-for-fun, user info and more will be implemented at a later date.  
## Simple steps to host this bot:  
 * Place your token
 * Place Redis server IP (can be internal)
 * Place port, and password (password not required)
 * Install Redis on a host of your choice. 
 * Use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` at the root of this repo to install the requirements, and `./purgepyc.sh` to purge `__pycache__` from all code folders.
